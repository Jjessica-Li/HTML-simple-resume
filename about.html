  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am passionate about programming, at beginning, It was absolutely way too hard for me to learn different coding as I had no idea what server, browser and internet are. However, once I learned one language which was Python. I started to understand what coding is, how the computer thinks and what computer, internet, browser and server are. Then I started to like it and wanted to learn more about different language skills. Now I am learning front-end development, because I am crazy about how to make a website that looks so good and easy for users to use. All I need to do for now is keep learning and get myself ready for the developer field. </p>
